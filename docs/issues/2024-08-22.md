# How SQLite Started

Welcome to the inaugural newsletter for [SQLite Fun](https://sqlite.fun).

Over the past year, I've spent much time appreciating SQLite. It has allowed me to build large applications on a small scale. I'm sharing the experience of what SQLite is capable of and what others are using it for. 

Get ready for a diverse range of content in this newsletter, including stories, code, and projects that all revolve around SQLite.

## Highlights

- [**The Untold Story of SQLite**](https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/) - An insightful interview with Richard Hipp, the creator of SQLite.
