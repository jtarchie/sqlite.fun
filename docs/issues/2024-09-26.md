# Using SQLite in production

**Hello SQLite Enthusiasts,**

Welcome to this edition of the SQLite newsletter. Whether you're here to enhance your database knowledge or explore the latest developments in the SQLite ecosystem, we have a variety of insights and resources for you this week.

---

Sorry, this is a week late. There were technical issues, but we got it out on a Thursday!

Please remember to submit your database and SQLite-related links to [us](mailto:newsletter@sqlite.fun) — blog posts, videos, GitHub repos, etc.

**Quote of the day:**

> If we're trying to make things easy on you, we shouldn't casually make you a Redis database admin in the process.

## Highlights
- [**Rearchitecting for SQLite**](https://wafris.org/blog/rearchitecting-for-sqlite) - Wafris migrated part of their stack from Redis to SQLite. They acknowledge it was not a drop-in replacement. This is a great example of using the right tool for the job for The Right™ reasons. — <small>[Michael Buckbee](https://wafris.org)</small>
- [**SQLite on Rails performance**](https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/15/sqlite-on-rails-the-how-and-why-of-optimal-performance/) - An overview of optimizing the performance of Rails with SQLite. They are working hard to make SQLite ready out of the box for Rails 8. They did the math! — <small>[Stephen Margheim](https://fractaledmind.github.io)</small>
- [**Turn on mmap support for SQLite connections**](https://oldmoe.blog/2024/02/03/turn-on-mmap-support-for-your-sqlite-connections/) - Thoroughly explains the [mmap support](https://www.sqlite.org/mmap.html) built into SQLite. With multiple clients accessing your database, mmap can offer significant performance boosts by using a bit more memory. — <small>[Oldmoe](https://oldmoe.blog)</small>
- [**SQLite is not a toy database**](https://antonz.org/sqlite-is-not-a-toy-database/) - This write-up provides an overview of SQLite's features with easy-to-understand examples. A great primer to share with friends, family, and coworkers to introduce them to SQLite’s niceties. — <small>[Anton Zhiyanov](https://antonz.org)</small>

## Code
- [Litestack](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack) - A Ruby gem that adds support for SQLite in Rails for full stack — jobs, DB, cache, async, and search.
- [qustar](https://github.com/tilyupo/qustar) - A library for building SQL queries in JavaScript.
- [sqlfluff](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) - A library that validates different SQL dialects.

## The Lighter Side
- [mmap warmer](https://www3.sqlite.org/src/file?name=ext/misc/mmapwarm.c) - If you decide to use mmap, this code can help warm up the mmap cache.
- [Backup strategies](https://oldmoe.blog/2024/04/30/backup-strategies-for-sqlite-in-production/) for SQLite in production.
