# Building, Compressing, and Auditing Your Databases

This is our second release of [SQLite Fun](https://sqlite.fun)! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

SQLite is [widely used](https://sqlite.org/famous.html), though it may not have the same development news cycle as many other databases. This makes SQLite Fun a bi-weekly newsletter.

Please submit your links to [us](mailto:newsletter@sqlite.fun) -- blog post, video, Github Repo, etc.

## Highlights

- [Build your own SQLite](https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-1-listing-tables) - This series uses Rust to build SQLite from scratch, offering valuable insights into the design and layout of the SQLite file format. Part 2: [Scanning large tables](https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-2-scanning-large-tables) has also been published. &dash;  <small>[Geoffrey Copin](https://hashnode.com/@Sylver)</small>
- [Log file compression with Zstandard VFS in SQLite Benchmark](https://logdy.dev/blog/post/part-3-log-file-compression-with-zstandard-vfs-in-sqlite-benchmark) - An in-depth series of blog posts exploring different compression mechanisms for SQLite databases, with benchmarks of all the knobs and dials to optimize the experience. &dash; <small>Peter OsinskiView</small>
- [Auditing and Versioning Data in SQLite](https://www.bytefish.de/blog/sqlite_logging_changes.html) - Proposes a pattern for using triggers to audit changes to a table, helping maintain revisions for inspection. &dash; <small>[Phillip Wagner](https://www.bytefish.de/)</small>

## Code
- [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) is a Rust library for managing SQL interactions. It works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.  
- [sqlite3-cmake](https://github.com/sjinks/sqlite3-cmake) supports the compilation of SQLite in your [CMake](https://cmake.org/) file. 
- [SQLite full-text-search support in Rails migrations](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52354) &dash; <small>[Zacharias Knudsen](https://github.com/zachasme)</small>
- [Vectorlite](https://1yefuwang1.github.io/vectorlite/markdown/overview.html) is an extension that adds vector database capabilities to SQLite. Claims to be faster than [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) and [sqlite-vss](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss).

## The Lighter Side
- ~~Tweet~~/X:
  > 15,000 requests/second! That's what I just got out of that $220/month EPYC 48-core hobby box from Hetzner running a basic Rails 8 scaffold MessagesController#show loading a single record from the DB with no caching of any kind. Hot diggity!

- [Pipe Syntax](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/5f218012b6e1a9db) - Proof of concept of Google's proposed functional [pipe syntax `|>`](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol17/p4051-shute.pdf) for `SELECT` queries.
- [Invisible Columns](https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/invisible-columns-in-sql) - Most databases support having columns that don't get returned in a `SELECT *` query. SQLite does not have this feature; however, it is beneficial to learn patterns from other database systems. &dash; <small>[Trevor Lasn](https://www.trevorlasn.com)</small>

Thanks for reading! See you in two weeks.
