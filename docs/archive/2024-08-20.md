# How SQLite started

Welcome to the inaugural newsletter for SQLite Fun. Thanks for joining.

We've all read about increased SQLite popularity over the past year. Here are
stories, code, and projects exploring SQLite.

- [**The Untold Story of SQLite**](https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/) - An interview with Richard Hipp, the SQLite creator. Find out what motivates Richard to write free software, why testing is important, and how many devices it actually runs on. &dash; <small>

- [**Node.js experimental support**](https://nodejs.org/api/sqlite.html) -Node.js v22.5.0+ added native bindings to SQLite -- requiring no `npm install`. The feature is experimental and on par with `bun`. &dash; <small>Node.js</small>

- [**SQL for fun and profit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf_V8NC58gg) - Watch a video introducing recursive common table expressions with a real-world example. &dash; <small> [Aaron Francis](https://www.youtube.com/@aarondfrancis)</small>

- [**Gotchas with SQLite in Production**](https://blog.pecar.me/sqlite-prod) - An experience report of _gotchas_ you should know. Learn from others before going to production. &dash; <small>[An≈æe's Blog](https://blog.pecar.me)</small>

- [**How we sped up Notion in the browser with WASM SQLite**](https://www.notion.so/blog/how-we-sped-up-notion-in-the-browser-with-wasm-sqlite) - Notion (more than a note taking app) uses SQLite to cache data in the browser. They explore different methods of persisting data, ensuring its non-blocking, and find out more what _"OPFS SyncAccessHandle Pool VFS because it didn‚Äôt have the requirement of cross-origin isolation"_ means. &dash; <small>[Notion](https://www.notion.so) </small>

## Code

- [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) enables vector searching for all your embedding needs. 3.3k ‚≠êÔ∏è
- [Redka](https://github.com/nalgeon/redka) is Redis re-implemented with SQLite. Started when Redis change their license, showing the power of SQL backed key-value store. 3.3k ‚≠êÔ∏è

## The Liter Side

- [SQLite News](https://sqlite.news/) has aggregated HackerNews posts related to SQLite.
- [RQLite 8.27](https://www.philipotoole.com/rqlite-8-27-loadable-sqlite-extensions-support/) supports loading native SQLite extensions.
- [Just use Postgres](https://mccue.dev/pages/8-16-24-just-use-postgres) why your default database should be Postgres instead of X-database (there's a section on SQLite ü§î).
